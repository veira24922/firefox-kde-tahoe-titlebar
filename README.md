# Firefox KDE Tahoe Titlebar
This is just a small repo that replaces the titlebar buttons (Close, Maximize/Restore/Minimize) with the MacTahoe one (**CREDITS TO VINCELIUICE FOR THE KVANTUM ASSETS**).

# Installation
> NOTE: This may not be fully accurate. Make sure that your titlebar buttons is on the left side (Like the macOS one).
1. Make sure you have Firefox installed on KDE (Fedora, Neon, etc.), then go to `about:config` and **Accept the Risk**. Make sure `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` is set to `true`.
2. After that, download the source code, and un-zip it.
3. Go to `about:support` and "click Open Folder" (Which is next to the Profile Folder).
4. Copy the chrome folder from your unzipped source, and move it to the Profile Folder.
5. Restart Firefox manually.
6. Now you're ready to go. Optionally, you may use [this KDE Plasma theme that goes perfectly with it](https://www.pling.com/p/2305696/).
